# Data


```{r}
# Load the dataset
bank <- fetch_ucirepo("Bank Marketing")
df <- bind_cols(bank$data$features, y = bank$data$targets$y)

# Encode categorical features as factors
df[] <- lapply(df, function(col) if (is.character(col) || is.logical(col)) as.factor(col) else col)

# Remove high-cardinality categorical variables
valid_cols <- sapply(df, function(col) !is.factor(col) || nlevels(col) <= 20)
df <- df[, valid_cols]

# Ensure target variable is a factor
df$y <- as.factor(df$y)
```

The dataset includes 45,211 observations and 17 predictor variables, encompassing both categorical and numeric features such as:

-   Client Attributes: age, job, marital, education
-   Banking Information: default, housing, loan
-   Contact Details: contact, month, day_of_week, duration
-   Campaign Metrics: campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome

The target variable, y, is binary and indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no). First, we imported the dataset by `ucimlrepo` R package. Then, all categorical variables were converted to factors for compatibility with the randomForest, lime, and Fastshap packages. And the high-cardinality categorical features (with more than 20 unique levels) were removed to simplify analysis and reduce sparsity in local surrogate models.
